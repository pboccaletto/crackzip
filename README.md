# CrackZip

CrackZip is a simple python script that will bruteforce a password protected zip archive using a dictionary attack. 
The user will provide as input the zip file and the wordlist he wishes to use. 

This project was originally cloned from "git clone https://github.com/machine1337/zipcrack.git". Despite that this is not a fork, I've over simplified the code to be run directly from command line.
I ended up rewriting it removing colors, decoration and interactive user input.
